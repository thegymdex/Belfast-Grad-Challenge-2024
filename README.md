# Belfast-Grad-Challenge-2024

Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission for the Belfast Graduate Program Code Challenge 2024.

## Project Structure

Detailed below is the project structure:

Belfast-Grad-Challenge-2024
          |
          |
          |
data  src  assumptions.txt

data - contains the file containing all prime numbers found. Can be deleted to test functionality.

src - contains all java files.

assumptions.txt - contains all assumptions made about the task.

## Running the Project

I used IntelliJ to create the project so opening it through that should have no issues at all.

The entry point to the program is the `PrimeFinderMainApplication` class.
